# LGS-96 Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2026-09-12 (version 1.0.1)_

LGS-96 is an unofficial browser extension that shows salary indications found in
LinkedIn job postings directly on the job cards of the search results. It is **not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to LinkedIn in any way**.

## What the extension reads

- Job cards on LinkedIn job list pages (job ID, card text fields such as
  company/location/native salary text).
- The public job-posting description of jobs you browse, fetched from LinkedIn's
  public guest endpoint, parsed **transiently in memory** to extract salary text.
  Raw descriptions are **never stored** and are **never sent anywhere**.

## What the extension stores locally

- Job ID -> parsed salary result (or "salary not detected") in your browser's local
  extension storage, kept for **3 days** (local cache, can be disabled and cleared
  from the popup at any time).
- Your preferences (language, local-cache enabled/disabled).
- Nothing is synced; nothing leaves your browser except what is described below.

## What the extension sends over the network

1. **LinkedIn**: for each job card without native salary text and without a cached
   result, the extension requests the public job-posting page from LinkedIn
   (roughly one request every 1 to 2.5 seconds at most, configurable in the popup,
   with backoff when rate limited and a per-session request budget).
   These requests happen on your browser and may be associated with your LinkedIn
   session by LinkedIn.
2. **Feedback reports (only when you explicitly submit one)**: when you hover a
   salary badge and choose to report an incorrect result, the extension sends to
   [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) (`https://formsubmit.co/ajax/...`) an email on
   behalf of the extension author containing **only**:
   - the job posting ID and its canonical URL,
   - what you selected/typed as the expected salary information (max 50 characters),
   - what the extension had detected (kind, value, source),
   - the detected posting language (one of the supported posting-language
     codes — English, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,
     Polish — or unknown), as stored
     in the local cache alongside the salary result (cache v3 `postingLang`),
   - the extension version and selected language.

   Reports contain **no** name, email, profile data, or job description text.
   FormSubmit processes the submission (including network metadata such as your IP
   address, subject to [FormSubmit's privacy policy](https://formsubmit.co/privacy.pdf))
   and emails it to the author, who stores it for the purpose of improving salary detection accuracy.

## What the extension does NOT do

- It does not collect browsing history, credentials, cookies, or profile data.
- It does not transmit job descriptions or page content to any server.
- It does not include analytics or tracking of any kind.
- **Cloud cache is not available in this version**: no data is sent to any
  extension-operated server. The feature may return in a future version and would be
  introduced with its own disclosure.
